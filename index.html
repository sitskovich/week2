        <p>"Good morning, future scientists! Welcome back! Before we start, let's get our brains warmed up. Please find your journal, which is also your seat for today. Once you're settled, put a proper heading on your paper—that's your name, the date, and the topic 'Science Review.' For the next five minutes, I want you to think back to our last science class. What are three things you remember? Just write them down in your journal. Once the timer beeps, we'll do a quick 'Think-Pair-Share' with a partner to see what you both remembered. Ready? Let's go!"</p>

We are a team, and our 'Student Contract' is our promise to make this a safe, fun, and amazing STEM year. Take a look at these classroom norms. Let's talk about why each one is so important for our work. On your desk, with a dry-erase marker, write down one reason why you think it’s important to always follow these rules. For example, why is it so important to 'be a good teammate'?"</p>
